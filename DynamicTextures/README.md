Dynamic Textures
================

The example program here is a CocosSharp implementation of [How To Create Dynamic Textures with CCRenderTexture in Cocos2D 2.X](http://www.raywenderlich.com/33266/how-to-create-dynamic-textures-with-ccrendertexture-in-cocos2d-2-x).

For right now the sample will only compile and run with release versions greater than v1.3.1.0 of CocosSharp.
